          <h1> Who are we?</h1>
          <p>
            &emsp; Since first opening our doors in 2021, we’ve entertained countless moviegoers with memories of a special day out.
          
          From the latest blockbusters to intimate dramas, with a dash of documentaries, sports and culture also in the mix, EVA’s diverse range of entertainment means there’s something for everyone.
          
          Pamper yourself in the trappings of Czechia’s premier luxury cinema, EVA Indulge, or lounge in the blissful comfort of our Beanieplex halls. Why not bring your kids for some Family Friendly fun, or treat your eyes to the astonishing clarity of the world's largest cinema LED screen, Samsung ONYX. To top it all off, dive into the most immersive movie experience on Earth - IMAX®. The choice is yours!
          
         We also take pride in the flavour-rich quality of our food & beverages, offering the best popcorn in town as well as an exciting variety of choices for patrons at any of our 38 locations nationwide. We count ourselves lucky and feel immensely proud to have played a small part in big moments; from the first time that kids see their superheroes come to life on the big screen, to the innocent beauty of a first date.
          
          At TGV, it’s not just about movies - it’s a total entertainment experience.
